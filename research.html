											<h2>Research</h2>

											<h3>Undergraduate Study</h3>

											<p>Years of undergraduate studies has equipped me with professional knowledge in Atmospheric Sciences. I am familiar with the improvement of atmospheric observation methods, and especially attracted to the mechanism of the establishment of weather theory and the possibility of numerical forecasting. Yet there still are many unknown problems in this field that need to be solved. For example, the hot issue anthropogenic climate change still has many uncertainties. The limited observation methods, accuracy and parameterization scheme used in numerical simulation for aerosols and cloud processes are waiting to be solved. All these existing and possible problems drove me to pursue deeper study and research in this realm.</p>

											<p>To learn fundamental knowledge and to acquire basic skills were my first steps in taking root in Atmospheric Science. For instance, by taking the course Integrated Detection of Atmosphere, I studied the observational equipment and theories of meteorological elements, which enabled me to understand the accuracy, advantages and disadvantages of each type of detection method. Thus, I was clearer with the data analysis and processing of the error sources in my projects. Besides, Dynamical Meteorology, which was the basis of all other theories, introduced me the most basic equations, fluctuations and other related theories in the atmospheric discipline. All calculations are carried out with Navier-Stokes equations included in the course. They also are the core equations in theoretical research and numerical weather prediction. Moreover, I mastered three most basic technical means for studying the movement of the atmosphere and the development of future weather more accurately in the courses Principle of Synoptic Meteorology, Statistical Weather Prediction and Numerical Weather Prediction. With my passion and endeavor, almost all of my major courses had a score above 90/100. Besides my major courses, I laid a solid foundation in mathematics, physics and computer science.</p>

											<h3>Research Experiences</h3>

											<p>Another step I took for delving into this field was to strengthen my techniques in research projects. In 2016, I recommended myself to Professor Minghuai Wang’s lab. Under his guidance, I led a team to research on <a href="articles/ar2.html">Analysis of the Positive Correlation of Precipitation and Aerosol Using Satellite Data</a>. Since it started in my sophomore year when we just began learning the basic courses of atmospheric science, we were not very familiar with atmospheric disciplines in the domain such as some concepts in cloud physics. The first thing we did was studying intensively the core literature From aerosol-limited to invigoration of warm convective clouds (Koren et al. 2014). Then our team collected data by obtaining the TRMM and CloudSat data sets and applied programming to match satellite data with NCL. In the process of performing programming calculations and analysis, I was responsible for implementing the core codes, so that other members could modify the drawing based on my codes. Our results of this research suggested the positive correlation between precipitation and aerosols. However, only statistical methods were employed in this research, so we were unable to find the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Based on the current research and literature, I assumed that the results were due to the uncertainty in satellite observation of clouds and aerosols. This year-long research was my first formal research and it was awarded as National Excellent Research Project. After this experience, I was more encouraged to expand my knowledge and skills in atmospheric science.</p>

											<p>In addition, recommended by Professor Wang, I had the opportunity of becoming a Mitacs Intern. Therefore, in the summer of 2018, I conducted an individual research on <a href="articles/ar4.html">Evaluation of Quantitative Precipitation Estimation from Model, Satellite and Radar</a> under the guidance of Professor Yongsheng Chen at York University in Canada. To gain a better understanding of data products, I downloaded data from various websites and looked for appropriate instructions to ensure that each variable had the same meaning and that the results were accurate. Then I performed data processing by NCL including standardization of data set units, time matching, and interpolation. Because there were no previous codes for reference, I wrote every code on my own. After the compilation, a long debugging process was required to modify the codes continuously for more accurate results. What’s more, in order to process the data more efficiently, many tips such as distributed data storage, manual parallel computing, and optimized codes were designed by me to minimize memory usage and to reduce computation time. This experience enabled me to conduct a research totally in an English environment. And three months’ training improved my proficiency in data analysis and use of Linux and NCL. Furthermore, I practiced my communication skills and writing academic papers in accordance with the requirements of the American Meteorological Society. I believe all these competences will help me excel in graduate studies.</p>

											<h3>Research Interests</h3>

											<p>I want to become an excellent scientific researcher in Atmospheric Science, and eventually continue to make contributions to the field of Atmospheric Science in research institutions, or return to the university to spread my knowledge and ideas. Therefore, I need to make progress through years of scientific research training. Obtaining a PhD is my short-term goal to achieve in the next five years. During my postgraduate years, I hope to apply the knowledge I have learned from my undergraduate courses, combined with some techniques and tools to conduct in-depth study and research in the frontiers of atmospheric science. For example, I expect to apply state-of-art techniques, especially artificial intelligence to weather and climate forecasting. After graduation, I intend to continue my research in universities or research institutions. In the long term, I will contribute to preventing the harm of some severe weather to people's lives and property. Also, I will continue studying the impacts of climate change on humans in the future.</p>

											<p><strong>My academic interests are mainly in two aspects: (1)cloud microphysics and its role in climate, and (2)mesoscale system and data assimilation.</strong> These two topics are closely related to my two scientific research projects at the undergraduate stage. Through these two projects, I deeply understand that initial conditions and parameterization, especially for clouds, are the most uncertainties in weather prediction. Also in climate models clouds and aerosols are the most significant uncertainties. I hope to have more in-depth research in these areas. I'd like to take advantage of models to deeply reveal the mysteries in atmospheric science, because I'm interested in and goot at computer programming and I hope I could reduce uncertainties and improve the performance of models.</p>

											<p>Many achievements in the field of Atmospheric Sciences in history were made during the PhD period of those famous scientists, so the PhD program was also a golden period for me. In order to make use of such a good opportunity to improve myself, first of all, I hope to learn more academic ideas through graduate courses, academic lectures and academic discussions with professors and classmates, so as to have a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of earth sciences. Secondly, through five years of scientific research training, I hope to master some practical tools for atmospheric science research and enhance scientific research ability, thus making valuable contributions by incorporating the theoretical knowledge learned from undergraduate study as well as ideas absorbed from academic lectures. Finally, I hope that based on the platform and resources provided by the university and research institutions, I could make progress in written English and oral English. Not only should I actively join the academic seminars in the university, but also I should take an active part in international conferences to share my research.</p>
