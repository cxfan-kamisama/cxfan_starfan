      <p>My name is <strong>Chongxing Fan</strong>, and I am an undergraduate senior studying in Nanjing University. I am in the School of Atmospheric Sciences. With solid knowledge of mathematics and physics, I have mastered the basics in the field of atmospheric science, and since I have great interest in computer programming, I am able to handle meteorology data using Fortran, NCL and other kinds of programming languages. Moreover, I have taken the classes about oceanography and earth sciences so I have learned some basics in these areas.</p>
<p>I fell in love with computer programming even when I was young. In this website you can see some apps I have made. Also I have learned some stuff about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So this website is the consequence of my learning. Based on a responsive HTML5 template <a href="https://html5up.net/verti">Verti</a>, I edited the text and pics in the source code and added some other fancy features.</p>

<p>Because of the poor performance in College Entrance Examination, I struggled a lot to get admitted to Nanjing University. With a not good score, I could only be subject to the university and let them appoint my major. So this is the reason I am in the School of Atmospheric Sciences. I've never heard of this field before. I searched online and found that it uses mathematics, physics and computer technology to solve the mystery of atmosphere. I was relieved since I was not sick of these subjects (lol). And after I digged into this field, I thought I was blessed because I was appointed to study Atmospheric Science instead of Computer Science. Although I'm still in love with Computer Science and Software Engineering, it is so tiring and competing that I can't bear it as it is a really hot major nowadays. Now I didn't regard the examination four years ago as a failure anymore. It gave me an opportunity to learn a brand new field I've never heard before. I am in belief that when god closes a door, he opens a window.</p>
<p>I like to schedule everything. I think it's a good way to keep me motivated and in high efficiency. I make a plan at the beginning of the week, always electronically kept, and keep track of the plan every day during the rest of the week. At the end of the week, I summarize the past week, sometimes by writing a report and sometimes by just writing a snippet after the weekly plan. In order to let my family know what and how I am doing, my family will have an online video meeting. In most cases I will make a PPT and deliver a presentation to my family, which is initially intended to avoid speaking loudly and disturbing my roommates.</p>

<p>Not only do I work hard to pursue a high GPA for myself, but also I teach my classmates who are struggling to study. Usually before I start, I will grab the structure of a subject and drawing a Knowledge Tree. By doing so, I will have a clear image of the subject and not get lost. As for some very difficult problems that I didn't know the answer, I will throw it out and discuss with my &ldquo;students&rdquo;. I found it really helpful to enhance what I had learned. In order to make me understood by others, I must have my statements make sense. I had to raise many possible questions to myself and think hard to come up with a explanation to convince myself first. My students also got very high score after I taught them, which makes me very delighted.</p>
