											<h2>[Best of Starfan Episode 1] Jogging with appropriate background music</h2>

											<i style="color: red; margin-bottom: 2em">For the readers who visit my website frequently, the long-term delayed update has brought disappointment to you and I sincerely apologize for this. I have been very busy recently because of the preparation for the application and have no time to write an article. But from this week, I will start a new series called Best of Starfan. I will share some of my creative living habits and learning methods through some articles, which may be helpful to you.</i>

											<p>In order to keep fit, I will go jogging regularly on the tracks in our campus since I entered Nanjing University. This is not my innovation, because there are many people on the tracks running, which may be the characteristics of Chinese universities. I have not seen someone running in the school tracks during my three months in Canada, but there are quite a lot of people jogging on the streets or in the park.</p>

											<p>If you just run alone on the playground, it seems a bit boring. Music is the only friend to accompany me. The selection of music is of great significance. The lyrical music is obviously not suitable for running, while the impassioned music can inspire and encourage me to try my best to achieve the goal. In addition, I like to follow the rhythm of music. For Chinese students, they may be very familiar when they were in elementary school or middle school, the school would organize teachers and students to run the tracks together, using big speakers to play a music specially designed for running, and let us follow the rhythm to keep our pace. I am deeply influenced by this mode, and also because I have learned some music since I was a child, I am particularly sensitive to the rhythm. Therefore, I will choose the songs with moderate speed so that I can keep my pace with the beat of the music.</p>

											<p>BPM means Beats Per Minute, which is an important indicator for measuring the speed of a song. BPM of the music used for running in the school is 172. You can listen to the sample below to feel the beats.</p>

											<audio src="uploads/jogging.mp3" style="width: 100%" controls></audio>

											<p>After a long period of experiment, I finally determined the range of running speed that suits me well, the slowest 165 beats per minute and the fastest 175 beats per minute. Personally, I like Japanese music very much. Although I don't know Japanese and I don't understand the meaning of the lyrics, but I really like the melody. So I picked up music that was both full of energy and speed in my list, and I picked about a dozen of them and uploaded to my smartphone. If there is no bad weather, I will wear a wireless headset, play the music in the list, set a timer to stop playing music after a fixed workout time so I know when I can stop, and then follow the rhythm to run the tracks. This feeling is very wonderful.</p>

											<p>If you are interested in this topic, you can turn to <a href="/resources.html">Resources</a> page to find some samples. If you want to make your own list of running music, I recommend a website that measures BPM: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm">Click Here To Visit</a>. A few months ago, I combined the music into a large audio file, and then added some voices using computer speech synthesis technology to remind me of the running time. If you want to do this too, I recommend using Adobe Audition to combine. Screenshot is shown below. This software is very easy to learn, but it's not cheap, though. As for voice synthesizer, I recommend Lang Du Nv, which is a free software and can be downloaded from the official website.</p>
