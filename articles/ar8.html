											<h2>[Best of Starfan Episode 2] Weekly Family Video Conference</h2>

											<i style="color: red; margin-bottom: 2em">I'm delighted that I have some spare time to write a new article for you. Today I'm going to introduce a family activity that people may think it unbelievable. It is called "Weekly Family Video Conference".</i>

											<p>With the development of science and technology, it becomes more and more convenient to communicate with each other, even though we are far away from each other. In the old days, it was not uncommon for students who left home and went to the university in a big city to get homesick. Now it is not a serious problem. For example, in China we have WeChat and it is so easy to learn that most of my family members have their own WeChat account, even for my grandparents. In other countries WhatsApp may be more popular.</p>

											<p>I created a WeChat family group and gathered my parents and my grandparents in the group. Every morning we will greet each other with word "Âê±" (a unique way in our family to say hello). In most cases the group is very quiet, unless a family member is doing something important and he/she needs to report his/her progress or situation to let everyone know.</p>

											<p>Sometimes just by sending messages is not enough. My family will miss me if they can't see me face to face for a long time. A video call is a good way to solve this issue. However, I want to make it a formal meeting in our family. So beginning in 2016, we hold our "Family Video Conference" every week. Many people will be surprised that I will do a formal presentation every week, that is, I will prepare my own PPT and present it to my family. I can put some news that I want my family to know in my PPT. On the one hand, I don't need to speak out and just let my family to read when it comes to some news that I'd like not to let my roommates know (I always hold the conference in my dorm). On the other hand, it is a good opportunity for me to practise how to do a presentation.</p>

											<p>In order to add some fun to the weekly meeting, based on this mode of video conference, I squeezed all of my creativity in my head and poured into my PPT through the years. The traditional program in our family meeting is called "Happy Guess". I will put some questions in the PPT and let my family members to guess the answer. I also invented a formula to calculate the scores they have got, which is named "Formula of Fan's Score". For example, the correct answer is 90, and the contestants give different answers. Calculate the difference between these answers and correct value. The contestant(s) with the least bias will get full mark, while the contestant(s) with the most bias will get zero score. Other contestants will get some points calculated by interpolation.</p>

											<p>If I need to implement this score system in our meeting, instead of calculating by hands or on a calculator, I will write some codes using Visual Basic for Application. It is a powerful tool to make some interactive stuff in the presentation. Apart from score system, I have also created other Applets and embedded in different kinds of my PPT slides to make it more fancy.</p>

											<p>I have put some examples online and you can download them to see how it works in our family. Please notice that they are all written in Chinese (since most of my family members don't know English).</p>
