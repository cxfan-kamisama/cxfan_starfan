											<h2>Personal Life</h2>

											<p>I was born in a family with dense intellectual atmosphere. My father graduated from Wuhan University in China, and my grandparents are all teachers. Therefore, they believe that knowledge can change people's destiny and pay special attention to cultivating my interest in study. However, only interest does not suffice. My grandfather showed me how to cultivate good study habits and find suitable learning methods step by step during my growing-up. As a result, from elementary school to university, after more than ten years of exploration, I gradually grasped the law of learning, and enjoyed the happiness of exploring unknown mysteries.</p>

											<p>I am a very self-disciplined person with a strong sense of time management.  I make daily schedules, weekly plans, and yearly blueprints. In order to work and rest accurately according to the timetable, I created an Applet named "schedule reminder", which played music to remind me at fixed times in a day. On the one hand, making plans help me take full advantage of the short working hours of a day and improve my work efficiency on the premise of maintaining adequate rest . On the other hand, I can focus on my direction without losing myself in mass of tasks.</p>

											<p>I have spent plenty of efforts in finding suitable efficient learning methods for myself. For example, I found that if I take the subway regularly, I would be able to memorize the subway station's announcement voice over time. Based on this discovery, when I memorize some knowledge points, I would employ computer speech synthesis technology to convert them into audios and listen to them every day. After a few weeks I am able to recite the materials.  In addition, "Zhou Zhou Qing" (that is, a weekly self-examination of knowledge that I have learned in previous week), portable handbooks, knowledge trees are all the effective methods I have tried, which provide a lot of practical experience for my study and even for my future research work.</p>

											<p>In addition, I have always insisted on selflessly sharing my knowledge, thoughts and methods. During my undergraduate years, I constantly look for positive and enthusiastic study partners to form a group of three or more people, either to discuss concepts and theories in our major or to exchange scientific research ideas in depth. In most cases I am a teacher in the group, but sometimes I will also raise some open questions to the group for discussion. There are also some poor-graded students as my study partner, but I still pay great attention to them as long as they have enthusiasm. On the one hand, explaining basic knowledge to them will help deepen my understanding of the concepts in a field. On the other hand, they will also put forward some fantastic ideas, which will also give me a lot of inspiration. I firmly believe in the power of cooperation. What I am pursuing is the massive output that small research group can produce.</p>

											<p>I have been thinking about my future career. Considering my personality, reality and future social development, I set my goal to become an excellent atmospheric research professor. I hope with the power of curiosity and interest to explore the unknown, by following the methodology accumulated in the past ten years, I could gradually uncover the dynamic mechanism behind the atmospheric phenomenon, and contribute to the accurate prediction of weather and climate. In addition, I also hope to spread my knowledge, thoughts and skills to the next generation. Just like the concept of "open source" in the field of computer science, I would be delighted if I could share my knowledge, ideas and skills, and make a positive impact on the vigorous development of the community and society.</p>
